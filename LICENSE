The licensing status of this code is not clear. The original source from 1984
was publishied in a magazine and is likely protected by copyright, even though
the magazine is long gone and the publisher Markt+Technik no longer exists. SMON
itself is an extremely popular 6502 monitor in Germany and has been widely
ported and adapted. The original authors were Norfried Mann and Dietrich Weineck
and the source was published over three issues of *64'er* magazine in 1984-85.

This port is a substantial rewrite and is mostly not based on the original 
source, but mostly because of the unclear licensing status of the original, I
can only release this in the same sprit as all of the other derivatives out
there - use this entirely at your own risk.

I see that some derivatives have been released as under MIT.
